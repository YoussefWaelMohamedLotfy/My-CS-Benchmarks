# My C# Benchmarks

This repository is a centralized collection of .NET Benchmarks that I find online from Blogs and Content Creators to try out various packages and tools that provide the maximum performance.

## Prerequisites

* Latest .NET 6 - [Downloads Page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

## Running the Benchmarks

The Projects should be built in `Release` mode to run on the optimized version of the build.

## Built With

* [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) - The framework used
* [Benchmark.NET](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/index.html) - Benchmark tool for .NET
